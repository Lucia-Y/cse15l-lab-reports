In order to download the Visual Studio Code application, we need to go the Visual Studio Code website https://code.visualstudio.com/ and follow the dowloading instructions here to download the application to our computers. After we sucessful download the Visual Studio Code application and open it, we can see the image above.

Firstly, we need to find our course-specific accounts for CSE 15L course in the website https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php. Secondly, we should connect to the remote computer using VSCodeâ€™s remote option. Then in the Visual Studio Code, we need to open a new terminal, and type ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu to the terminal, but remember to replace zz by letters in our course-specific accounts. Since it is our first time connect to the server, there will be a message "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?", and we need to answer "yes" to make sure we give the permission to connect. Finally, we enter our passwords for our accounts, and we will connect it successfully.
