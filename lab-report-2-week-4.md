__Relatiohsip among bug, symptom, and failure-inducing input:__ the code has the bug that when the text does not end with ")" or "]", the code can't recognize the ending of the text. So when using the failure-indcing input, the text does not end with ")"or "]", it causes a symptom that the output has a infinity loop, which leads to the out of memeory error. But after fixing the code, it gives the correct output, which is the links.
