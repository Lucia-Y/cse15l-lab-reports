__Code Change:__ I think there is a small code change that will make my program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks. We should ``break`` the while loop when there is a `` ` `` outside the ``[]`` for the link. Also, we should still consider and return the link when the `` ` `` is inside the ``[]`` for the link, and there is an extra ``]`` inside the ``[]`` for the link as well.

We should still consider and return the link when we press the ``return`` key on the keyborad after the ``[](`` and put the link on the next line, and then, press the ``return`` key on the keyborad after the link, and put ``)`` on the next line.
