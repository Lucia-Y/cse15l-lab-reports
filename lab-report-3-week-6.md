I went to the terminal in my computer,and then I created the ```~/.ssh``` directory by using ```mkdir -p ~/.ssh```. After that, I used ```cd ~/.ssh``` to go into the ```~/.ssh``` directory, and then I used ```open -t config``` to open my ```config``` file.

Screenshot for editing the file in the terminal of the computer:

I copied these three important lines to my ```config``` file, and I replaced the ```zzz``` of the ```cs15lsp22zzz``` to my account, which is ```ahp```.

Screenshot for using ```ssh``` command to login into my account:

I only typed ```ssh ieng6``` to login to my account.

I created a new file in the ```~/.ssh``` directory, named ```newFile```, and then I used ```scp newFile ieng6:~/``` to copy this ```newFile``` to my account.

## 2. Setup Github Access from ieng6

Screenshot for public key storing on Github:

I created a new SSH key in my terminal and then, I followed the [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to add the new SSH key to the Github.

Screenshot for public key in my account:

I used ```ssh-keygen``` to create a pair of files which are the public key and private key. When I used ```ls```, I could see ```id_rsa.pub``` is the public key in my account.

Screenshot for private key in my account:

I used ```ssh-keygen``` to create a pair of files which are the public key and private key. When I used ```ls```, I could see ```id_rsa``` is the private key in my account.
